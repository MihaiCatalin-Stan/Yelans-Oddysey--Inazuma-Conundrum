Yae Miko, I've been searching for you.
Well, well, if it isn't our intrepid traveler. What brings you to my humble abode, Yelan?
I've been on a journey, seeking the missing pieces to restore peace to Inazuma. And I believe you, Yae Miko, are the final piece of this intricate puzzle.
Oh, me? Why, I'm just a humble shrine maiden, my dear. What could I possibly offer?
Humility doesn't suit you, Yae Miko. I know you're more than just a shrine maiden. You have the influence, the knowledge, and the charisma that can tip the scales in our favor.
Well, if you insist. I do have a knack for bringing people together. But what makes you think I'll lend my hand to your cause?
Because I know there's more to your connection with the Electro Archon than meets the eye. I've seen the subtle dance between you two, the unspoken understanding.
My, my, Yelan. Are you implying there's a love story in the making?
Of course not, how could I imply that. I merely meant it as a story of balance. You know how to navigate the currents of power, and Raiden Shogun needs someone who can challenge her, guide her without fear.
You're quite perceptive, aren't you? Perhaps I do have a role to play in all of this.
I knew you'd see the bigger picture. We need your influence to bridge the gap, to convince the Shogun that there's another way to achieve peace without sacrificing everything.
So, you want me to be the voice of reason, the mediator between mortal and Archon?
More like the mischievous whisper in Raiden Shogun's ear, guiding her toward a path that doesn't lead to isolation.
Oh, Yelan, you truly understand the art of persuasion. I suppose I can't resist being the puppet master in this grand play.
I knew you'd see the opportunity.
Now, I've brought you a little something to lighten the mood on your journey.
A romance manga?
Trust me, my dear, even the mighty Shogun needs a bit of romance in her life. It might soften her up a bit. This one is filled with passion, desire, and a dash of mischief. Perfect ingredients for thawing the icy heart, don't you think?
I suppose it's worth a try. But do you have any practical advice, Yae Miko?
Ah, the practicalities of dealing with the Almighty Shogun.  Keep her on her toes, spice up the conversation. Challenge her stoic demeanor.
So, you're suggesting I play with fire?
Precisely! After all, life's too short to be serious all the time. Plus, a little spark can go a long way in melting even the coldest of hearts.
I appreciate your advice, Yae Miko. I'll give it a shot.
Good luck, my dear Yelan. May your journey be filled with unexpected twists and turns, just like a good romance manga.
