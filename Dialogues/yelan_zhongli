Does Osmanthus wine taste the same as you remember?
But where are those who share the memory? Ah, the aroma is truly nostalgic. Oh, sorry, just reminiscing about the past. It’s been so long, retired life gets lonely sometimes. I never expected to find a kindred spirit in the appreciation of such refined taste.
May I have a cup with you, kind consultant?
Certainly. It's not every day I get to share a cup of Osmanthus wine with a connoisseur. Loneliness is an affliction that transcends time. Retirement does have its moments of solitude. Yet, here we are, in each other's company once more, Yelan.
Nice to know you still remember me. It’s a pleasure to have met you again, Zhongli.
Indeed, Yelan. The Funeral Parlor continues to thrive under the careful guidance of Director Hu Tao. I've also heard rumors of its best consultant.
Oh, you mean the illustrious consultant who knows more than he lets on, perhaps even the secrets of ancient gods?
I must admit, my knowledge does span the ages.
You know, Zhongli, you remind me of someone I once knew. A consultant of extraordinary talents, a geo-archon, perhaps.
Do I now?
Morax, was it? Or am I mistaking the name?
My, my. It seems my secrets aren't as well-hidden as I thought.
You can't fool someone whose job is to unveil mysteries, Zhongli. Now, about that Osmanthus wine...
As promised, a cup of Osmanthus wine to seal our reunion.
To old memories and new friendships, Zhongli.
To enduring bonds and the mysteries that linger in the taste of Osmanthus wine.
