Who approaches? Speak your purpose.
I’m Yelan, we haven’t met formally, but I’ve heard about you, Xiao.
Yelan. Coming here like this, you have no respect for the ways of the adepti. What business do you have here?
I've come to talk. It's been said that even adepti face challenges, and I thought--
Challenges? You think you understand the challenges of an adeptus? Mortals know nothing of our burdens.
I don't claim to fully understand. But life is tough for everyone. I thought we could share our experiences.
Share experiences? Mortals like you can't comprehend the struggles we face. If you want to talk, prove your worth. Challenge me.
Challenge you? Xiao, this isn't about a physical duel.
Life is a battle, Yelan. If you can't face me here, how can you face the harsh realities outside?
Fine, Xiao. If a duel is what it takes to break through your walls, then so be it. But remember, the real battles are fought within.
Show me what you've got, then. Let's see if you can handle the storm.
