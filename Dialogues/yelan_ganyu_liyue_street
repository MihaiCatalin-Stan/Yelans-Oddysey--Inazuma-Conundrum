Here we are, you will be able to find Xiangling here. She will happily help you with a wonderful dish to calm down the vengeful waters. Since Nahida's wisdom is unmatched, she will help you decipher everything. Here you have some crucial documents that will guide you in your journey. And a flower from me, to remember me by. May Rex Lapis watch over you, Yelan.
Thank you, you're too kind. I will treasure this flower and make sure to keep our nation safe.
I have no doubts about that. Also, I know the flower is delicious but please don't eat it just yet. *yawn* It will make you sleepy, you don't want that.
Of course not. In my line of work, sharp instincts are essential. Farewell!
Until we meet again, I wish you best of luck! Off I go now, got lots of things to do.
