Indeed, Ei has gone rogue again. People tried to stop her but only you have the power to make a difference. This matter is to be threaded lightly, and I expect you to know diplomacy better than anyone. 
Indeed, it is one of the key traits that one needs for this job. I won’t disappoint. 
Very well then. You shall find a perfect weapon in Monstadt, and the residential bard over there will provide more guidance. After all, Inazuma needs to be freed, and the Anemo Archon will have the perfect advice. Make sure to seek out Yae Miko, that devious fox is sure to know Ei better than anyone, a bit too well if i dare say.
Sounds wonderful, I will be sure to listen to the bard’s ballad. It seems the winds of fate are blowing in my favour. As for Yae Miko, let’s just say I’ve danced with a few foxes in my time, and they always reveal more than they intend. Besides, it’s always fascination when alliances run deeper than the surface, don’t you think?
As the Archon, ethically, I can’t help but abstain from answering. But your various experiences only prove to me that you are the best person for solving this issue. Take care, and remember, even in the darkest storms, a glimmer of hope can illuminate the path.
I appreciate your counsel, Inazuma shall see the dawn of a new day. May our paths cross again under clearer skies.
