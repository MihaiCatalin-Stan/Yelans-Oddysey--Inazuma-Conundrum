You fought well, Xiao.
Defeat means nothing, failure isn’t something to be proud of.
Life is a game of chance, Xiao. We all play the hand we're dealt. Some hands are tougher than others, but it's how we play them that defines us.
A game? Life is no game. It's a trial.
Trials and games, they share more similarities than you think. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. But we keep playing, hoping for a better hand.
What are you getting at?
Life deals us cards, but we also have choices. It's not about the hand we get; it's about how we play it. You've faced immense loss, haven't you, Xiao?
Loss is a constant companion. I lost my family, my happiness.
I can't pretend to understand the depth of your pain, but I know loss. We all do. It's a part of the hand we're dealt. But it doesn't mean the game is over.
Easier said than done.
It's okay to feel, Xiao. Grieving doesn't make you weak. It makes you human.
I'm not like you. I'm not human.
Emotions don't discriminate. Even adepti can feel sorrow, anger, and love. It's what connects us, what binds us together.
I closed off my heart to protect myself from the pain.
But closing off your heart won't make the pain go away. It's about finding a way to live with it, to let it shape you without consuming you.
I never thought I'd find solace in the words of a mortal.
Mortals have their wisdom, Xiao. Just as adepti have their strength. We can learn from each other.
Maybe... maybe there's more to this than I thought.
Life is a journey, Xiao. And sometimes, even the strongest among us need a helping hand to navigate the storm. Here, Xiao. A token of understanding and strength.
A flower?
Spider lilies represent remembrance and the transient nature of life. They bloom in adversity, a symbol that beauty can arise from the darkest moments.
A flower won't change the past.
No, but it can be a reminder that even in the harshest winters, spring will come again. A beautiful story once said: "What's wrong isn't me; What's wrong is the world." Sometimes, we need a small reminder of beauty to challenge the darkness.
Your story may be right, but mortal stories won’t change the fate of adepti. Where there is light, there will always be darkness. 
Unless you shine bright enough. Stories can teach us how to face our fate with courage. Just like you did today, facing me in this duel.
I didn't expect this.
Life is full of unexpected moments, Xiao. Embrace them. They might just lead you to a path of healing and understanding.
Healing? Understanding? Mortals speak of such things as if they're easily attainable.
They may not be easy, but they're worth pursuing. You've already taken the first step today.
Perhaps... perhaps there's more to life than endless trials.
And perhaps there's more to us than the roles we play. Let the spider lily be a reminder that even in the darkest moments, there's a chance for beauty to bloom.
