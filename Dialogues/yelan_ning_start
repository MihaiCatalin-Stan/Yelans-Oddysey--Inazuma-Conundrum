It's the third time this week. "You will get a wonderful holiday after this mission", you said. Well, guess who did not get a holiday? Me!
Patience, dear. I will make sure you are compensated properly.
Compensation? I do appreciate your generosity, my Lady, but you know I'm not one to sit around waiting for handouts.
I wouldn't expect anything less from you, Yelan.
So, tell me, what do you have in mind? Another thrilling mission, perhaps?
You read my mind. I have a special task for someone as resourceful as you. I need you to venture into Inazuma and find out what went wrong in that land of secrets.
Inazuma, huh? Sounds like a challenge. But, you know I thrive on those, don't you?
I do indeed. Your charisma and wit will serve you well amidst the intrigues of Inazuma.
Well, my Lady, I shall embark on this mission with style and grace. And when I return, you can be sure I'll have quite the tale to share.
I have no doubt you will, Yelan. Ganyu will be waiting for you and give you all the details you need. Just remember, the "rewards" will be as intriguing as the mission itself.
