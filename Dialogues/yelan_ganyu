Hello there, it is an honor to meet you Miss Yelan. Lady Ningguang told me a lot about you.
This blinding sunlight is such a pain. No way I can get a nap in this weather.
Sorry, what did you say? 
Ah, Quilins really do have sharp hearing. The pleasure is all mine, just call me Yelan. I was told you have some important info for me, regarding a special mission.
Of course Yelan, please follow me. It is rumored that a great threat fell upon Inazuma. Your task is to bring balance back into the land of mysteries.
How exciting, venturing into the unknown.
Here we are, you will be able to find Xiangling here. She will happily help you with a wonderful dish to calm down the vengeful waters. Since Nahida's wisdom is unmatched, she will help you decipher everything. Here you have some crucial documents that will guide you in your journey. And a flower from me, to remember me by. May Rex Lapis watch over you, Yelan.
Thank you, you're too kind. I will treasure this flower and make sure to keep our nation safe.
I have no doubts about that. Also, I know the flower is delicious but please don't eat it just yet. *yawn* It will make you sleepy, you don't want that.
Of course not. In my line of work, sharp instincts are essential. Farewell!
