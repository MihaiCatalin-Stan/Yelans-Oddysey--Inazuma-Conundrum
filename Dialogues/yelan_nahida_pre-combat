Miss Kusanali, it is an honor to finally meet you. I come seeking your wisdom, and I have something you might enjoy in return.
Good morning Yelan, I was expecting you. We should get going right away. There are too many things in this world that you'll miss if you don't get there on time. And leave the Osmanthus wine here, I have been waiting for it. 
Always one step ahead, as expected. Hope I didn’t let you wait for too long, Nahida. 
Not at all. Your timing is impeccable. You actually got here faster than expected. Why don’t we talk about what brings you here?
I heard a storm is brewing beyond the seas and that you might know more about it.
Indeed, but first we have to look deep into people's minds and gather some insight. Let us proceed.
