Hey Layla, it's a pleasure meeting you. I've been searching for the Grand Sage, Alhaitham. I heard you might know the way.
Oh, hey dear. Grand Sage, huh? That's a tough one...But I'll do my best to help. Just woke up from a nap, though, so bear with me.
No problem, Layla. I appreciate your help. Anything you can tell me about where he might be would be great.
Hmm, let me think. Grand Sage likes to spend time near the Celestial Temple, where the ancient trees whisper secrets. Have you checked there?
No, I haven't. The Celestial Temple, you say? How do I get there?
Head west from here. But, um, be careful of the curious little creatures around. They're harmless, just a bit mischievous. Actually, let me guide you there.
Thank you, Layla. I appreciate your guidance. And by the way, you seem really sleepy. Are you sure you're okay helping me right now?
Oh, I'm always sleepy, but helping friends is important. Besides, I'm the best guide when I'm half asleep. Trust me!
