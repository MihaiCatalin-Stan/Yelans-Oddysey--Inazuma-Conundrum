Hello, fellow traveler! How are you finding Sumeru’s forests?
A fellow friend from outside of Mondstadt too!
Greetings. I navigate the forests as I navigate life, with careful steps and a penchant for the unexpected.
Well met! I'm Collei, and this is Amber, the Outrider of the Knights of Favonius.
Hey there! Always great to meet someone from beyond the borders. What's your name?
Names are like leaves in the wind, here one moment, gone the next. You can call me a traveler passing through.
Come on, you must have a name. It's only fair. We've shared ours.
Yes, you have to do what is fair!
Fair is a subjective concept, my dears. Let's not get bogged down by trivialities.
Well when you put it that way, it truly is a trivial matter.
Speaking of not getting bogged down, there's this incredible party happening at Diluc's winery in Mondstadt. You should totally join! It's a gathering of the city's finest.
A party, you say? Diluc's winery, you mentioned? Well, I suppose I might find my way there if the stars align.
That's the spirit! Now, about that name...
Don’t be so insistent, Collei. What brings you to our neck of the woods, traveler?
The name will reveal itself when the time is right, my curious friends. Until then, let's focus on the path ahead and the revelry that awaits. I’ve heard rumors of the elusive Dendro Archon. Any ideas where I might find them?
Dendro Archon? Sorry, I don't have a map for that. Amber, any ideas?
Afraid not. But, there's a wise girl called Layla, she’s rather delighful. She might know more. You'll find her near the village.
Layla, you say? Thanks for the tip. I might swing by at that winery of yours if the winds carry me in that direction.
Wonderful, a party is always a good time, but hopefully Sumeru will be a joy in itself. Layla’s wisdom is like moonlight dancing on calm waters, and her charm, well, it's as enchanting as a lullaby. You might find her with a dreamy gaze, for Layla, the sleepy sage, is often lost in the realms of her own musings. Have a good journey, mysterious traveler. And who knows, you might just find Layla's company as delightful as a night under the stars.  
We’ll see you at the party, friend!
Oh, by the way, name’s Yelan. Maybe you’ll hear it at the party. Maybe not. Safe travels, friends.
