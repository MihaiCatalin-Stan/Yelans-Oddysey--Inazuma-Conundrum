Phew, that was fun! And your cooking doesn't look half bad either.
Well, I had certain missions which required me honing my cooking skills. But let's not talk about those dark days in Snezhnaya. 
A story for another time, then. Now it is time for my delicious stew. And I also prepared another surprise for you. Lemme know what you think, Guoba already said he loves it.
Hmm, well then that makes two of us. Such a wonderful and heartfelt dish, I feel it rejuvenate my spirits. I must take some with me, since I just came back from a holiday that ended prematurely. 
Well of course, I already prepared some takeout for you. A variety of dishes, I think they will be quite helpful in your journey. 
Here we have Wanmin Restaurant's Boiled Fish. A wonderful and elegant dish, but it is best served with a plate of chilli on the side! The spicier, the better. I thought I would make the restaurant's signature dish. In order to honor you and your friend with it.
Haha, I can't help but agree. Gouba loves his chillis, so you sure knew what you were doing there. And since both me and my godly friend is pleased, I shall declare you the winner of this competition.
Amazing, now it is time for you to give me the help you promised. Of course I can't disclose any confidential details, but I'm sure you know this is of crucial importance. 
Well of course, and your dango is right here. It's fresh and simply delighful, one might say it is suited for an Archon. 
That might just work, you gave me a wonderful idea. Thank you, Xiangling, and farewell to you and Gouba!
Farewell, Yelan, make sure to eat well!
