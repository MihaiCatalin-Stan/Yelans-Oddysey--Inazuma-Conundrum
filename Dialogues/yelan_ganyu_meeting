Hello there, it is an honor to meet you Miss Yelan. Lady Ningguang told me a lot about you.
This blinding sunlight is such a pain. No way I can get a nap in this weather.
Sorry, what did you say? 
Ah, Quilins really do have sharp hearing. The pleasure is all mine, just call me Yelan. I was told you have some important info for me, regarding a special mission.
Of course Yelan, please follow me. It is rumored that a great threat fell upon Inazuma. Your task is to bring balance back into the land of mysteries.
How exciting, venturing into the unknown.
