Hello? Xiangling, are you here?
Perfect timing! Lunch is right around the corner! Soup, steak, and my wonderful slime condensate dessert. What would you like today?
Actually, I am here on business today. 
Ow, you're no fun. Food first, business second. 
I'll make sure to bring you lots of customers if you help me. I actually needed your help too, so why not help each other? Ganyu told me your cooking expertise is unmatched.
Well of course, I am the most creative chef in Liyue. A visionary, you might say. So I'll do you one better: you have a cook-off with me, and I'll give you whatever you need.
Hmm, not bad. An idea I am willing to entertain.
You can use any ingredient from the kitchen, just astound me with your specialty. Ready?
I was born ready. The better question is, are you ready?
